</p>
<p><b><font color="purple" size = 4> This is a very brief scientific bio, for more details please take a look at <a href = "../CV/CV.htm"><u>my CV</u></a>.</b></font>
   <p><font size = 5> Dr. Hamsa Padmanabhan is the principal investigator of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Ambizione Grant at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. She was previously a CITA Fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, Toronto, Canada and a Tomalla post-doctoral fellow at the Institute for Particle Physics and Astrophysics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. She graduated from IUCAA, Pune, India with a Ph.D. in Physics in December 2015.</p>
    <p>
    She has a wide breadth of research expertise, ranging from theoretical investigations (in quantum field theory and relativity) to data-intensive, observation-oriented astronomy and astrophysics. The  novel halo model framework developed by her is used extensively in the community to interpret observations of atomic and molecular gas  and  to exploit the tremendous potential of future astrophysical surveys in the radio, millimetre and optical wavelengths. These studies, in which she plays an active role ---  with collaborators from India, Europe, Canada and the USA ---  probe both fundamental physics and cosmology.
    
   
   
    <p>She was the co-lead of the chapter on Cosmic Dawn and Reionization for the White paper on Fundamental Physics with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), one of the biggest astrophysics projects of the coming decades.
    </p>
   
<p>Hamsa has received several prestigious awards and fellowships all throughout her career. She was selected as a Goldman Sachs Global Leader by the Institute of International Education (IIE) and the Goldman Sachs Foundation, and is one of the few in the world who has the honour of a minor planet in the solar system being named after her. </p>
