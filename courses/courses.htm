<p ><font size = 5>  I am currently involved (Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023) in the teaching  on the course  <b>Methods of Mathematical Physics II</b> conducted at the University of Geneva for physics majors. </p>

<p> I gave a 14-lecture doctoral course (designed in 2022) at the University of Geneva over March - May 2022 on
<p><b><i><u><a href="reionization.htm" target="_blank"> Observing the Cosmic Dawn: how did the first stars and galaxies form? </u></a></i> </b> </p>
    <p>I am teaching this course again in Fall 2023, with material available <b><i><u><a href="reionization_2023.htm" target="_blank"> here. </u></a></i> </b></font></p>


    <p><font size = 6 color="blue"> <i><b>  Previous teaching and supervision activities include:</b></i></font>

<p><font size = 5>  (i) <b> Substitute lectures</b> in large undergraduate classes of ~ 100 students, for the course Astrophysics I taught at ETH Zurich over Fall 2016 and Fall 2017. </p>

<p> -- This course develops basic concepts in astrophysics as applied to the understanding of the physics of planets, stars, galaxies, and the Universe. The course objectives include illustrating physical principles through a variety of astrophysical applications; and  providing an overview of research areas in astrophysics. The topics covered include basic astronomical concepts, radiative transfer, stellar and galaxy evolution, structure formation in the Universe and an introduction to cosmology.</p>
<p>
       <p>(ii)  <b> Teaching involvement  </b> in the courses Physics I and Physics II at ETH Zurich, an undergraduate course for both physics and non-physics majors over Spring 2018 and Fall 2018. </p>

<p> -- The Physics I course gives a introduction to the concepts and tools in physics, including mechanics of point particles and rigid bodies, elasticity theory, elements of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, periodic motion and mechanical waves, electricity and magnetism. The Physics II course is a continuation of Physics I, and provides an introduction to the  theory of waves, electricity and magnetism,  elements of quantum mechanics with applications to spectroscopy, thermodynamics, phase transitions and transport phenomena. 
</p>
<p>

(iii) <b> Lectures at several lecture series </b> held weekly at CITA, Toronto over 2019 - 2020, on topics in astrophysics and cosmology, to  broad audiences consisting of graduate and undergraduate students. </p>

<p> -- I was a lecturer on current topics in cosmology for the University of Toronto Astro 101 Summer Undergraduate Research Program (called UofT SURP) conducted over July-August 2020.
