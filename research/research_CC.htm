<p> <font size = 5>
We discuss the cosmological constant problem and <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2284" target="_blank"><u><b>provide a possible solution</b></u></a> in the backdrop of the emergent perspective of gravity. We first provide a brief overview of the conventional approach to cosmology in which the Friedmann equation is used to describe the dynamical evolution of the universe. We then describe an alternative, epoch invariant parameterization of cosmology in which the Friedmann equation is now parametrized by a set of variables whose values are manifestly independent of the epoch at which they are measured. Using this epoch invariant parametrization, we construct a dimensionless number (which we call CosMIn), which measures the information content accessible to an eternal observer in the universe. Theoretical arguments suggest the value of CosMIn to be equal to 4&#960;. We show how the introduction of CosMIn and the postulate that CosMIn = 4&#960; allows us to determine the correct, observed value of the cosmological constant for a GUTs scale inflation and the allowed range in the matter and radiation energy densities as determined from cosmological observations. We also discuss the cosmological constant problem in the backdrop of the emergent gravity paradigm, in which the postulate that CosMIn = 4&#960; acquires a natural explanation. This provides a fundamental physical principle that determines the value of the cosmological constant. We discuss the results and consequences for a novel and alternate description of cosmology.
